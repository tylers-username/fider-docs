OAuth is an open standard for authentication and authorization. Fider is an OAuth client that can connect to any OAuth2 provider to enable a fast, easy and secure sign in process.

Fider has native support to Facebook, Google and GitHub. To add any other OAuth provider please follow this guide.

### Registering a new OAuth Provider

While logged in as an Administrator, navigate to **Site Settings -> Authentication**.

This page list all registered providers, either Enabled or Disabled. To register a new provider, click **Add New** and fill the form with all the required information. If you're new to OAuth, we've prepared a <a href="#oauth-common-providers">list of how to configure the most common providers</a>.

<h3 id="oauth-testing">Testing</h3>

Before enabling any provider on Fider, we highly recommend that you keep it disabled and use the **Test button** to confirm it's working properly.

**Test button** becomes available after registering a new provider. Whenever clicked, Fider opens a popup and redirects you to the provider of your
choice to start the authentication process. Once authenticated, you'll be redirected back to Fider and a report will be presented. Once you're happy with the configuration,
you can enable it and make it available for everyone to use during the sign in process.

#### Twitter

Unfortunately Twitter doesn't fully implement the OAuth2 protocol and the authorization flow. This means we cannot use this process to add Twitter authentication to Fider.

If you'd like to use Twitter as a sign in method for your site, please cast your vote on [Add Twitter as authentication method](https://feedback.fider.io/ideas/1/add-twitter-as-authentication-method) as this requires internal changes to Fider.
