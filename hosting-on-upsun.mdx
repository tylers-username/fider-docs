The Fider application ships with a `.upsun/config.yaml` that defines and version-controls applications and services. This enables you to simply create a project on Upsun and push your code to have a ready-to-use Fider instance.

### Prerequisites

##### An [Upsun](https://upsun.com) account

It's free to get started with the Upsun trial. [Sign up](https://auth.upsun.com/register)

##### The Upsun CLI (optional)

The Upsun CLI is optional, but useful for commands like `upsun project:create` for creating an app project and `upsun push` to deploy code. Comprehensive installation docs can be found [here](https://docs.upsun.com/administration/cli.html).

###### Install via Homebrew

```bash
brew install platformsh/tap/upsun-cli
```

###### Install via Bash

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | VENDOR=upsun bash
```

###### Install via Scoop

```bash
scoop bucket add platformsh https://github.com/platformsh/homebrew-tap.git
scoop install upsun
```

##### E-mail Sender (optional)

This Fider repository is pre-configured to use Upsun's built-in SMTP service. However, we recommend switching to Mailgun when you are ready to go to production.

### Deploying your instance

##### Step 1: Create a new Upsun project

* **Via the Upsun CLI**: `upsun project:create`
* **Via Upsun Console**: Click "Get Started" from [console.upsun.com](https://console.upsun.com)

Your Upsun project acts as a Git remote for your code‚Äîenabling you to deploy production changes with no more than `git push`. If you used the Upsun CLI to create your project, the remote has already been added as `upsun` for you.

##### Step 2: Deploy your application

1. (optional) `upsun project:set-remote` - Needed if you created your project via Upsun Console
2. `upsun push` - the same as `git push upsun`

**ü•≥ Congrats!** Your project is now running on Upsun. You can get the public URL to Fider by running `upsun url --primary`.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** The default SMTP provided by Upsun may land your Fider emails in spam

**Reminder:** To keep your instance always up to date with latest features and fixes, update your fork every once in a while.

##### Future Maintenance (optional)

To simplify first-time setup of Fider on Upsun, a `.environment` file has been provided which provides Fider's expected environment variables. The `.environment` file may be simplified by migrating some values to Upsun's [env variable manager](https://docs.upsun.com/development/variables/set-variables.html#create-environment-specific-variables) which can be accessed via the [Upsun Console](https://console.upsun.com) and the Upsun CLI. 

It is recommended that secure values be set using Upsun's env variable manager to avoid committing them to git.
